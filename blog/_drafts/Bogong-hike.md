Got off to a flying start on the Friday when my car broke down at glenrowan maccas.
Luckily the Chalet had a working bee so Jody gave me a lift from there. 
So Ryan and I spent the first day of the hike loading wood into the chalet for winter before Matt & Catey made it there.

The party set out early next morning.  
We were on track to begin with as Lea Young joined us on the way up to Wallace's Hut.
But a few hours later, we came to an "unexpected intersection" and it turned out that we'd missed the first actual turn of the journey. 
But we were able to get back on track easily enough and we made it to that night's hut without much issue.

Our second day got off to a strong start when we took a warmup lap around the campsite looking for the track that lead downhill. After a steady couple of hours' we made it to the river at the bottom of the valley for lunch. 
Speaking of bottoms, after we forded the river Ryan decided that since he had wet feet, it would be an excellent time for a swim.

The afternoon was much harder slog as we started the ascent of bogong itself. I wasn't a fan.

But eventually, we found our way to Cleve Cole Hut which was way nicer than I expected. It's built of stone instead of all the other ones which are wooden and there's a nice selection of reading materials available.

The next morning, Matt and Catey went off to watch the majestic sunrise while Ryan and I decided that staying in the nice warm hut was a much better idea. They totally got engaged -they'll deny it though.

But eventually we left the hut and made the final ascent. Being civilised folk, we had a cuppa on the cairn. While we were up there, a glider got towed up from the airfield and we got to watch that go for a few spins around the mountaintop which was fun.

But eventually we headed off down the staircase back through the treeline where we found Peter from the Chalet waiting for us with the leftovers from their lunch which was very welcome after a couple of days of pita bread Lunches. 

So that's those are my highlights from this Easter, have I missed anything important?
