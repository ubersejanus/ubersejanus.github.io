It's odd that the place that your mother happened to be when she gave birth to you has so much impact on the way that most of us will proceed to conduct themselves over the next 80-odd years.

It's probably fair to say that we have the most divisive national holiday going around, but I guess I'll run with it.

So this is what Australia is to me.

![Campfire in the High Country](https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1484/24575820986_19d25165be_z_d.jpg)

A campfire burning bright â€” popping and cracking
Unseen creatures scurrying about the brush
Staring up into a deep-dark sky, where endless stars are all I see
That's Australia to me.

  <p>A pool of crystal water, fed by hundreds of metres of rocky falls<br>Surrounded by trees and bushes. Bird calls echoing<br>Filled with friends laughing and swimming, jumping and playing<br>That's Australia to me.</p>

  <p>A rocky outcrop rising out of a sea of yellow fields<br>Tiny plants finding purchase in a crevice<br>Gum trees, roads and creeks criss-crossing their way to the horizon<br>That's Australia to me.</p>

  <p>A small, but ridiculously hot, path through the sand dunes<br>The white sandy beaches that it leads to<br>and wondrously blue water lying beyond<br>That's Australia to me.</p>

  <p>Sun-drenched road signs far from town<br>A brilliant sunset that seems to last all afternoon<br>Driving hundreds of kilometres and seeing nothing but animals and scrub<br>That's Australia to me.</p>

  <p>Returning from the other side of the world<br>Getting into the bush<br>Seeing the sights, smelling the smells, and hearing the sounds of the land I call home<br>You better believe that's Australia to me.</p>
