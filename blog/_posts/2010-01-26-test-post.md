It's odd that the place that your mother happened to be when she gave birth to you has so much impact on the way that most of us will proceed to conduct themselves over the next 80-odd years.

It's probably fair to say that we have the most divisive national holiday going around, but I guess I'll run with it.

A campfire burning bright â€” popping and cracking
Unseen creatures scurrying about the brush
Staring up into a deep-dark sky, where endless stars are all I see
That's Australia to me.
