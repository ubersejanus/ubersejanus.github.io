I find kinda hard to avoid being disappointed that the last time anyone was more than 2,000km from the planet was in 1972.

So let’s dial the clock back even further. I’d love to talk about the chilling “For every human being who looks up at the moon in the nights to come will know that there is some corner of another world that is forever mankind.” speech written in case Mike Collins was to make the return trip by himself, but let's tale a look at what was happening in 1924...

</ul>
How far we've come between 1924, 1969 and 2014. Where will we be in 2059?
