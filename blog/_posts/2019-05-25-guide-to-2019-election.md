Since I'm not working for the AEC tomorrow, I'm pleased to present "Brad's Guide to Political Parties"! 

I've done my best to not be too biased, but these are my opinions. I hope that they'e of some use to some of you.

<!--more-->

#### Liberal Party of Australia ####
The dominant partner of The Coalition, and Australia's pro-business party. Financially conservative and in favour of small government. Despite the name 'liberal', they're a very conservative bunch. Somehow the Liberals have a reputation as the 'good economic managers', but I think that is utter bollocks.

#### The Nationals ####
The coalition's minor party, allegedly the party of small family farms and the defender of regional Australia; but I reckon they represent agribusiness and mining.

#### Australian Labour Party ####
The ALP has a background in the union movement and are usually backed by the ACTU. They are the more progressive of the two major parties and traditionally like to invest in healthcare, education, infrastructure and social welfare.

#### The Greens ####
Socially progressive party with a strong environmental bent. The Greens as a political movement got started when the Tasmanian Government wanted to dam the Franklin River, and it turned out that getting the Commonwealth Government onside was super useful. Very keen on democracy, social justice, and non-violence.

#### Australian Conservatives ####
Corey Bernardi meets the Family First party.

#### Australian Democrats ####
A party elected on the promise of "keeping the bastards honest" which quickly found out that you need to be honest yourself if you want the people to keep voting for you

#### Australian Workers Party ####
A party for the workers. Either they distrust unions, or they think that Labor has sold out to big business. I'm not sure which.

#### Citizens Electoral Council ####
Anti-Big Four Banks party, keen to break them up.

#### Climate Action! Immigration Action! Accountable Politicians!####
A party who like exclamation marks and clearly doesn't understand how much legislation politicians have to deal with. They say that their representatives will vote the way that you tell them to on the internet.

#### Democratic Labour party ####
Splintered from the ALP back in the 50s when Archbishop Mannix thought that that they were getting dangerously communist, the socially conservative DLP successfully kept the working class vote split for a couple of decades, keeping the Liberals in power until Whitlam and the early 70s.

#### Derryn Hinch’s Justice party ####
Derryn Hinch promotes a specific kind of justice, which I personally consider closer to revenge. A populist party that on one hand thinks that judges shouldn't have any discretion but on the other hand, it's OK for Senators to use parliamentary privilege to ignore court orders.

#### Fraser Anning’s Conservative National party ####
For when One Nation just isn't racist enough.

#### Health Australia party ####
Anti-Vaxxers.

#### Help End Marijuana Prohibition (Hemp) party ####
Wants all marijuana, all the time.

#### Independents For Climate Action Now ####
Left wing, anti-immigration detention party that also wants action on climate change

#### Liberal Democrats ####
Not associated with either the Liberals or the Democrats.  
A mixed bag, really. On the one hand, they want to repeal anti-discrimination law but on the other hand they they also were in favour of marriage equality. Libertarians, they're fine so long as you aren't disadvantaged.

#### Pauline Hanson’s One Nation ####
Racists.

#### Pirate party ####
Keen on internet freedoms, no censorship of any kind, and love them some privacy.

#### Republican Party of Australia ####
They just want to do away with ol' Liz Windsor. Not linked to the Republican Party of the USA.

#### Rise Up Australia party ####
Super racists. To the extent of deporting all the Muslims.

#### Secular Party of Australia ####
Mainly concerned with ending tax breaks for churches

#### Shooters, Fishers and Farmers ####
People who are up in arms about that pesky National Firearms Agreement and how we'd all be a lot better off if John Howard hadn't done away with all the military-grade firearms that were hanging around in the general community. They also think that National Parks should be open for all manner of activities that would damage them.

#### Socialist Equality party ####
Lots of like to call The Greens communist, but the Socialist Equality party is *actually* affiliated with the Fourth International, wants to nationalise most industries and bring capitalism to it's end. They're Trotskists rather than Stalinists though, so that's nice.

#### Sustainable Australia ####
I actually think that they are legit worrying about there being too many people in the country, not just using it as a cover for racism. That's not to say that I think they're correct of course. But some policies have merit.

#### The Great Australian party ####
Apparently the things stopping us from making Australia great are income tax and the Family Court. It's OK though, they'll totally make up that tax money by taxing all those multinationals "properly".

#### The Small Business party ####
"Cutting red tape" - ie, slashing business taxes

#### United Australia party ####
Look, I can understand how people would vote for One Nation... we've seen throughout history that if you can frightened people enough about "the other", they'll vote for you to "protect" them - hopefully with extreme prejudice. But Clive? A bloated billionaire who's lost more money in the past decade than most of us will see in a lifetime? C'mon.

#### Voteflux.org ####
Another "we'll vote how you tell us via the website" party. This one less keen on exclamation marks.
