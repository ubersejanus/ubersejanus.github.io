excerpt: The trip log for my overnight hike into Sealer's Cove.
---

Kate, Matt, and Hannah were doing the three-day Wilson's Prom Eastern Circuit, so, literally never having hiked the Prom after 20+ years as a Scout in Victoria, decided to come in and meet them at Sealer's Cove for the final push. Luckily, I have a bit of flexibility with my working hours on a Friday, so a twilight solo trek in sounded like a good use of late summer.

##Friday##
Start: 6.30pm  
Dusk: 8.30pm
End: 10.00pm  
Weather: Clear, night

* From Telegraph Saddle, I bravely headed into the unknown - with nothing more than the very-well marked trail to guide me. As I started my way down the eastern side of Mt Ramsay, the sunlight was ebbing away - but with such a well-maintained and wide path (and a nice bright moon,) I was able to continue along for quite some time before stopping to pull out my headtorch.

* By the time I reached the boardwalk, night had truly fallen and there was very little to see. Except for when looking up, a wonderful star-filled sky was looking down on me from above. I ran into a little trouble when I reached the Cove, not realising that the campsite was still some distance away, I wasted a fair bit of time scurrying around looking for the campsite before checking the map and seeing that I still had a bit of a walk along the foreshore.

* The tide was up, but not too much. I was able to make my way along the foreshore easily enough, and despite the darkness I was able to ford Sealers Creek without difficulty. My final problem was then trying to find my friends! I had anticipated that they would still be awake, but the campsite was very quiet and asleep by the time I got in so I strung up my hammock not far from the toilets and resolved to deal with the problem tomorrow.

##Saturday##
Start: 8.30am  
Lunch: 12.00pm  
End: 1.00pm  
Weather: Sunny

* Most of the track between Federal Mill and the Ada Tree Picnic Area is actually a closed road. There was an old gate that's still there that confused us momentarily. Our trusty map/compass bearing and the GPS showed that we were on the right track.


##What I learnt##
* Should make 

* Camelbak should not be relied upon

* The Bump is not a campsite

* When people say that you should start on doing the Queen's Scout as soon as possible, they are right.
