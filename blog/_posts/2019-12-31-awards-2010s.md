It's been a few years since the last one, but I've been thinking about the year with enough time to present my end-of-december review in the format of an award show.

As usual, there are no trophies on offer, but I *am* more than willing to email a PDF certificate to those winners who want something to stick to their fridge.

<h3>The HRH The Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex Award for Excellence in Partying</h3>

<h4>Brett Ryan</h4>
<p>For sustained excellence in the field of throwing parties.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">No one else has thrown as many high quality parties this decade as Brett has. Most famously, the annual Beefy's Birthday Pub Crawl, but also just SO MANY 'just because' parties, and I think that the tail end of The Beefyville might have just snuck into this decade? If not, I'm going to give partial credit anyway.</p>
<p>Truly, you are the host with the most.</p>

<h3>The Defecating Penguin Award for Doing Cool Shit with me</h3>

<h4>Laura Blake</h4>
<p>Extremely challenging to choose this one, because I try and make a point of only doing cool shit.</p>
<p>However, as my relationship with Laura largely consists of 'flying to the same state and jamming as much fun as possible into the number of minutes available,' on a purely percentage basis I think I have done more cool stuff with Laura than anyone else this decade.</p>

<h3>The Good Times Award for Greatest Altitude Achieved</h3>

<h4>Annie Phelan</h4>
<p>I don't know what our cruising altitude was that time we flew to America, but I assume it was higher than a regular domestic flight is. That was a good time though. Not the flight so much as the adventure at the other end, obviously.
10/10, would adventure with again.</p>

<h3>The "The Mountain Goats Award" for Making It Through This Year (Though It Killed You)</h3>
<img style="height: 300px; width:auto;" src="/blog/assets/2017-12/mountaingoat.jpg" alt="" />

<p>This award is for everyone. Over the past ten years, you've overcome your challenges and achieved so much. I'm really proud of you guys.</p>

<p>We've made it to 2020!</p>

<p>Can't wait to see what you all achieve next ðŸ˜Š</p>

<h3>The Chairman Kaga Memorial Award for Fine Dining</h3>
<img style="height: 300px; width:auto;" src="/blog/assets/2017-12/chairmankaga.jpg" alt="" />
<h4>Sarah Chan</h4>
<p>For indulging Tom's ridiculous special dietary requirements (and denying me a second meal) at your wedding and arranging for the world's fanciest and most expensiveist Vegemite sandwich ever.</p>

<h3>The Saint Nicholas of Myra Award for most Christmas Spirit</h3>
<img style="height: 300px; width:auto;" src="/blog/assets/2019-12/st_nick.jpg" alt="" />
<h4>My Housemate Kate</h4>
<p>There's a lot to like about living with Kate: adventures, work stories, her amazing couch.</p>
<p>But one thing I didn't realise for nearly 12 months was how deeply she gets into Christmas. Our house spends December bedecked with enough LED lighting to land a cesna in the outback and I. am. here for it.</p>

<h3>the Samuel E. Wright Memorial Award for being Better Down Where it's Wetter</h3>
<img style="height: 300px; width:auto;" src="/blog/assets/2014-12/sebastian.jpg" alt="Sebastian the Crab" />
<h4>Cairns Moot</h4>
<p>Ahhh, that one day when Queensland Rovers took me on a scenic tour of the waterfalls, transparent pools, uncomfortably clear and deep lakes and natural waterslides all around the Cairns region.</p>
<p>Definitely the single best water (and road trip/singing) based day of the decade.</p>
<p>I would go on that adventure again in a heartbeat, and you all should come with.</p>

<h3>The Louis Daguerre Award for Drawing with Light</h3>
<img style="height: 300px; width:auto;" src="/blog/assets/2019-12/daguerre.jpg" alt="" />
<h4>Hannah Stockfeld</h4>
<p> may have only known Hannah for just over half this decade, but I'm reasonably confident that there is no one with whom I am in more photos with during the past ten years.</p>
<p>I very nearly changed my 'no trophies' rule to present this as the Golden Selfie Stick, complete with golden selfie stick; but the galaxy needs order.</p>
<p>Hannah is also the NAB/AFL Rising Star, the newest friend who made the best impact on my decade.</p>

<h3>and, finally, the coveted Copulating Jelly Baby Award for being Fucking Sweet:</h3>
<img style="height: 300px; width:auto;" src="/blog/assets/2017-12/jellybaby.jpg" alt="" />
<p>When I was thinking about what was the best event I did this decade, two main things came to mind.</p>
<p>Firstly, that time we went to Tom's birthday at Wet n Wild and went and found a bunch of waterfalls and swimming holes afterward.</p>
<p>And then secondly, the time I went out to dinner on Sunday night because Slav-Dogs was comin' to town and ended up going on a lightning mid-week ski adventure to Mt Hotham.</p>
<p>So I'm giving this award to both of those events.</p>
<p>Because I can.</p>
