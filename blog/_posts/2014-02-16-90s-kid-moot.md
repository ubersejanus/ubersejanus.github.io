I’ve always said that it’s poor form to evaluate a camp before you’ve had a shower, so after giving the weekend due consideration, I want to congratulate Brush Park Rover Crew and Sydney North Region for an amazing Moot (if training has taught me anything it's that participants make just as much impact on how awesome a weekend is as the organisers.)

In a textbook case of "It's not better or worse, it's just different" it was nice to go to a Moot where 'participating in the activities' and 'not sinking cans at breakfast' were both things. It was also interesting to see NSW's "subcommittees are stupid, that's what we have Rover Crews for" approach to event management in action.

Thanks to Brush Park both for the Moot and for taking such great care of us Interstaters - especially Cowie for driving me to and from the campsite (an amazing campsite, by the way,) Jamie- who in addition to being Large and In Charge, bent over backwards to help us out and also made sure we all made it offsite somehow. Also, Erin who is One Of Us now, but was the one to make Victorian participation happen.

All in all, I must admit that there ain't no party like a Brush Park party
