A tedious testiment to the traditions of yesteryear.

Basically, the fiancial equivalent of the appendix &mdash; although cheques seldom attempt to kill you by getting inflamed, they are an atrophied reminder of what once was.

However, money is money (once three days have passed) and can be exchanged for goods and services.

Three and a half stars.
