I’ve never been to the Remembrance Day service before, so it was very interesting. It was much more like Reserve Forces Day than Anzac Day, I suppose that since Anzac day has become a bigger deal people are more keen to speak there?  This was more ... simple, although no less dedicated.

The usual VIPs - the Governor, MPs, the Lord Mayor, ADF &amp; RSL bigwigs, along with the Shrine Trustees were joined by most of the Consular Corps, a reminder that we and the Kiwis are weird for making Anzac Day our primary day of commemoration.

Another thing I noticed was the unusual flag arrangement - Australian Flag, Union Jack, French Tricolour. <a href="http://www.shrine.org.au/Remembrance/Flags-of-Remembrance" target="_blank">Turns out they have rules about which flags they fly</a> based on which countries have their national memorial days when. They also will fly unit flags on their individual memorial days. I don’t know how they decide whose flags will fly November 11 - maybe they always use the two imperial flags to try and cover as much ground as possible, or perhaps they have a rotation?

Governor Chernov mentioned in his speech that the Shrine of Remembrance was dedicated on Remembrance Day in 1934 in a ceremony attended by 300,000 people at a time when barely a million people lived in Melbourne, and while today’s ceremony had barely a fraction of that number, I still felt like Chief Inspector Finch.

I got this feeling of connection, and I could see the whole thing stretched out as a long chain of events stretching back to General Monash getting the politicians to agree to construct his vision ... I felt that although I stood there 80 years after the dedication, I was still much closer to the beginning of this tradition than the end.

Lest we forget.
