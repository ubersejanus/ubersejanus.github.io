There was a time when everything was still. All the creatures of the earth were asleep &mdash; or nearly all. The Great Father of All was the only one awake. Gently, he awoke Pelor. As he opened his eyes, a ray of warm light spread out across the sleeping earth. 

"Pelor, I have work for you." he said "Go down to the earth and awake the sleeping spirits. Give them purpose. 

Pelor glided down to earth and saw that it was bare. But he awoke and called together the great spirits, and together they fashioned the world and all its creatures and all the folk that would live there.

These spirits were...

Her commandments are few: 

* Luck favors the bold. Take your fate into your own hands, and Avandra smiles upon you.
* Strike back against those who would rob you of your freedom and urge others to fight for their own liberty.
* Change is inevitable, but it takes the work of the faithful to ensure that change is for the better.

The god of thawing, beauty, and the arts, Corellon is the patron of arcane magic and the fey. <img src="corellon.jpg" style="width:150px;float:right;margin:0;">He seeded the world with arcane magic and planted the most ancient forests. Artists and musicians worship him, as do those who view their spellcasting as an art. He despises Lolth and her priestesses for leading the drow astray. Sehanine is his wife, and they are revered by Elves above all other gods.

He urges his followers thus:

* Cultivate beauty in all that you do, whether you’re casting a spell, composing a saga, strumming a lute, or practicing the arts of war.
* Seek out lost magic items, forgotten rituals, and ancient works of art. Corellon might have inspired them in the world’s first days.

Libraries and wizard academies are built in her name. 

Her commands are also teachings:

* Seek the perfection of your mind by bringing reason, perception, and emotion into balance with one another.
* Accumulate, preserve, and distribute knowledge in all forms. Pursue education, build libraries, and seek out lost and ancient lore.

<p style="margin:0; text-align:center; font-size:medium;">Chaotic Neutral</p>

They expect their followers to abide by these commandments:

* Recognise that death is a part of life. It is not an ending but a beginning, not a punishment but a necessity.
* Help others die with dignity at their appointed time and no sooner. Act against those that would artificially prolong their life beyond natural limits.
* Do honor to the dead, for their strivings in life brought us to where we are now. To forget them is to forget part of yourself.

###The Black Gods###

These deities —whose worship isn't sanctioned by the priests of the pantheon gods— are evil. While sometimes these deities aid the pantheon, at others, they work against them or aid their enemies. They have their own cults, attracting social outcasts and villains to their worship, exhorting these followers to pursue evil ends or commit destructive deeds.

**Asmodeus** is the god of the Nine Hells. He is patron of the powerful, god of tyranny and domination, and the commander of devils.

**Loviatar** is the god of war and conquest. Militaristic nations of humans and goblins serve her and conquer in her name. 
Gruumsh is the god of destruction, and overlord of marauding barbarian hordes. Where Loviatar commands conquest, Gruumsh exhorts his followers to slaughter and pillage. Orcs are his most fervent followers.

**Lolth** is the god of shadow, lies, and spiders. Scheming and treachery are her commands, and her clerics are a constant force of disruption in the otherwise stable society of the evil drow. 

**Tiamat** is the evil god of wealth, greed, and envy. She urges her followers to take vengeance for every slight, and she is the patron of chromatic dragons.

**Torog** is the god of the Underdark, patron of jailers and torturers. Common superstition holds that if his name is spoken, the King that Crawls will burrow up from below and drag the hapless speaker underground to an eternity of imprisonment and torture. 

**Vecna** is the god of undead, necromancy, and secrets. He rules that which is not meant to be known and that which people wish to keep secret. 

**Zehir** is the god of darkness, poison, and assassins. Snakes are his favored creation, and the yuan-ti revere him above all other gods.

<h3 style="text-align:center;margin-bottom:0;">Nusemnee</h3>
<p style="margin:0; text-align:center; font-size:medium;">Neutral Good</p>

The daughter of Zehir and a powerful devil was originally one of her father's assassins, but was redeemed by a High Priest of Pelor she tried to kill when he saved her from death. <img src="nusemnee.png" style="width:150px;float:right;margin:0;">Now she is the god of redemption, heroism, and hope; and the girlfriend of Eilistraee. Her worship is tolerated by priests of the Pantheon, but not encouraged &mdash; it is opposed by the priests of the Dark Gods as she purges the evil from a mortal's soul as soon as they seek redemption. Numerous redeemed antipaladins enter her service.

* It is never too late to seek redemption
* True heroism does not come from good deeds. It comes from doing good when it matters.
* Nobody is perfect. Those who seek to be perfect will fail. It is not a shame to fail, and it is not a waste to try.
* A man is better than the worst thing he has ever done.
