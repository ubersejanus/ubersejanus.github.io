Brad Peters is an IT Technician, working hard to make sure that businesses across Victoria have the tools and knowledge they need to succeed and thrive in today's high-tech interconnected environment. 

Brad has been blogging for a long time, but in fits and starts. Mostly, you get accounts of his travels, expedition reports, reflections, musings on history, and the occasional work of fiction.

Brad is one of over 5,000 adult volunteers across the state who support the development of young people through Scouts Victoria â€” he specialises in adventurous activities, particularly abseiling.

Brad lives in Melbourne and spends his spare time exploring, learning things, climbing, doing photography, and spending too much time on the internet.
