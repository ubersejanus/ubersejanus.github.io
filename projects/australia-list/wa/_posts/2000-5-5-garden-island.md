AKA Fleet Base West - the Royal Australian Navyâ€™s primary base on (in?) the western half of the country. 

Home to the only submarine escape training facility in the Southern Hemisphere and one of five in the world.

Approximately 70% of the island is a nature reserve. The bridge goes through the Naval Base though, so access is super limited.

A different friend of mine lives here!
