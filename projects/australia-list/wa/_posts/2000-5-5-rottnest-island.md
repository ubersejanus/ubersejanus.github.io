Affectionally known as Rotto, and to the Noongar people Wadjemup, 

Rottnest is a big island approximately 40 minutes from Fremantle by ferry/diveboat. It’s basically one big tourist resort - there’s no private ownership of any land

It's mostly famous for being the home to Quokkas, small rat-like marsupials that give the island it’s name.

There are some cool salt lakes on the island, depending on the conditions, sometimes they turn red and look weird!

The surf here is obscenely clear and the beaches are really pretty &mdash; there’s plenty of Scuba diving done in the surrounding waters as well!

There are a number of lighthouses on the island. Lighthouses are cool.

There’s a country club where you can play golf, lawn bowls, tennis, etc.

There are only a handful of cars though. Luckily, there are hundreds of bikes for you to be able to hire and ride around the island to your heart’s content!

Once upon a time, the island was used by the WA Government as a jail for undesirable aboriginals, so there’s a bit of that history about the island.
