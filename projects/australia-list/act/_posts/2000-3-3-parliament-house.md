One of the largest buildings going around, Parliament House is home to the Australian Parliament. Like many parliaments across the world, it inherited the red/green colour scheme of the Palace of Westminster, but they have been tastefully muted to the colours of ochre and eucalyptus respectively, so that's a nice touch.

Parliament House was pretty much buried under the top of the hill itâ€™s built on, the inventively named Capital Hill... This means that it is possible to roll down the side of the building, although experience shows that it's a *really* big hill, and you'll be really dizzy when you do get to the bottom...

The building has quite a lot of fairly interesting tidbits of Australian history scattered around, and some history of Canberra displays too. The Flag flying over this building is the size of a large bus.

Back in 2005, someone tried to ban the security guards at Parliament House from calling people "mate". This lasted for all of one day.
