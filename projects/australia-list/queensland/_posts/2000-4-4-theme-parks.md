The Gold Coast is probably most well known for being home to Australia's best theme parks. 

Wet 'n' Wild, Seaworld and Movie World are all part of one unholy alliance, leaving Dreamworld out in the cold and not invited to the "Three Park Super Pass" scheme.

Nothing but water slides.

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Seaworld</h3>
<h5><a href="http://seaworld.com.au">Website</a> • <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Sea+World/@-27.9572417,153.4255161">Google Maps</a></h5>

Seaworld is a sea world. There's a bunch of wildlife exhibits, you can swim with dolphins and so on. They also have a bunch of waterslides.

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Movie World</h3>
<h5><a href="http://movieworld.com.au">Website</a> • <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Warner+Bros.+Movie+World/@-27.906957,153.3131103">Google Maps</a></h5>

Warner Brother's Movie World on the Gold Coast is all about Movies. There's even a studio next door, and its slogan is "Hollywood on the Gold Coast"

All the rides are appropriately film/cartoon themed.

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Dreamworld</h3>
<h5><a href="http://www.dreamworld.com.au">Website</a> • <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Dreamworld/@-27.8635076,153.3152531">Google Maps</a></h5>

Aside from being the odd one out, Dreamworld's other claim to fame was the Australian series of Big Brother being filmed on the premises. They used to open the complex up when it wasn't occupied, but it has since been knocked down.

Dreamworld now also has an accompanying water park, WhiteWater World. Together, they are the country's largest theme park.
