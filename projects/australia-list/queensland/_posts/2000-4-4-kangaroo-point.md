The Kangaroo Point Cliffs are one of the coolest things about the Brisbane CBD. No other capital city offers you the chance to go abseiling just across the river from the CBD in your lunchbreak or whatever, but that's just how Brisbane rolls.

They also look pretty sweet at sunset, or when you're riding a bike along the Brisbane River.

Other things you can do here include rock climbing (obviously) and kayaking.
