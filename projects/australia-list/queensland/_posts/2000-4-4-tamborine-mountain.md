Home to many an amazing waterfall

Also home to exciting tea places, places that offer scones and botanical gardens. It's part of the Gold Coast tourist region, so there's a lot of places that you can pay to do things.

The Parks up here all seem to have little paths off to the side, they make me happy, unlike parks down here in Melbourne which have an air of “You shall have fun here, and here. BUT NOT OVER THERE!”
