While yes, we mention a large number of Gardenses in this rambling document, Roma Street  
1) has a kiddie “train”  
2) has waaaay more different types of plants than any of the others. There’s like five specific zones. It’s awesome.

There is also a lookout over the lake that is absolutely fantastic for people watching. 

Often lizards and other, less cool, animals hang out there, chillin’

Just outside the gardens, at the very top of the hill is the Old Windmill, one of the city’s oldest buildings
