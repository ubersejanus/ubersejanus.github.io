The rockpool above the main falls is a nice place to swim, although the water is **super** cold. There is also the ability to jump from the rocks above which can be fun, if you like being terrified?

There's a nice view from the bottom of the falls, but it's probably not worth the trip if you're only coming to go for a swim.

The drive from Brisbane is also very picturesque.
