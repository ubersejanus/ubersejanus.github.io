Built on the site of one of Bendigo's historical Chinatowns, the museum showcases the history of Chinese immigrants to the Bendigo and their culture.

Where do you think the world’s oldest Chinese Dragon is? If you guessed “I don’t sodding know, China?” You’d be wrong, it’s in Bendigo. Also living here is the world’s loooooooooooooooooooooongest dragon.

It includes an impressive collection of Chinese currency through the ages, as well as an extensive collection of 19th century Chinese costumes
