It really does!

A hands-on science museum that has a ridiculously big Tesla Coil to create lightning.

They also have control of the old pumping station next door which has exhibits on a lot of Victorian-era engineering feats.

It incorporates the Melbourne Planetarium too, for the joy of stargazing with the comfort of inside.
