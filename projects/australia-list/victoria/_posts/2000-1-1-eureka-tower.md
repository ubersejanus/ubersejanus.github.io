Home to the best 360 degree view of Melbourne going around, the Eureka Tower is an 88 story skyscraper on the edge of the CBD.

The best views are generally at night, especially if there happen to be fireworks happening for some reason.

The elevator is super fast, and they have this thing called "the edge" where you stand in a glass-bottomed room that is slid out from the side of the building so you can look down. They also play the sound of glass breaking, so that's fun apparently.
