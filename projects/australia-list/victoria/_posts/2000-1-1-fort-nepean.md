Part of the chain of 19th-century fortifications defending the entrance to Port Phillip, Fort Nepean fired the first Australian (possibly the first allied) shots of both world wars. Those two shots were the only time any of the Port Phillip defences fired in anger.

One of our Prime Ministers drowned/was kidnapped by/defected to the Chinese here.
