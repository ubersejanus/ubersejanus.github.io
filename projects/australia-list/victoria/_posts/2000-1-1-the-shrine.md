Australia is big on war memorials, and this one offers a surprisingly good and free view of the city

Planned by none other than [General Sir John Monash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Monash), Commander of the Australian Corps during World War One and the last man to be knighted on the field of battle, Melbourne's Shrine of Remembrance is the largest of Australia's six State War Memorials.

At the centre of the Sanctuary, where many memorials have placed an Unknown Soldier, is the Stone of Remembrance, a marble slab inscribed with "GREATER LOVE HATH NO MAN". The building is designed so that at 11am on November 11th each year, a ray of sunlight shines on the word love, however thanks to Daylight Savings, a mirror is now required for that to happen.

It's home to over 150 commemorative ceremonies a year, culminating in the Anzac Day Dawn Service and Commemoration March.

Since 2002, significant development has occurred, transforming the artificial hill the Shrine sits upon into a visitors centre/museum including greater disabled access to the undercroft and the wider building.
