A large, open-air museum/tourist attraction showing Ballarat during the Gold Rush back in the 1850s. They have a bunch of performers dressed up like redcoats, and miners, and there are lots of historical things on sale. They have a setup where you can try gold-panning, too. The advertising would have you believe that you can find REAL GOLD! Statistically though, the likelihood is probably about the same as winning the lottery.

Also includes a closed air Gold Museum which we've never visited as In this context, “includes” means ‘can include for additional fees’.

After dark, they have a sound and light show that recreates the Eureka Rebellion, which is called Blood on the Southern Cross and is quite good.
