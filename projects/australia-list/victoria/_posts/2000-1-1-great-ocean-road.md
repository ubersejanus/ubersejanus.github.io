The Great Ocean Road is a majestically scenic two lane road that goes along the Shipwreck Coast from Torquay to Warnambool. It is one hell of a way to spend a weekend.

Some of the things you will drive past include:

#### The Twelve Apostles
There are currently nine remaining sandstone pillars sticking out of the water. They look cool, but there has literally never been a time when there was twelve of them.

Occasionally they fall down, and it’s a big deal. In 2015 they discovered another five of them which were about 30 metres below sea level — this was actually a big deal, because sea stacks like these should not be able to last for the thousands of years that they have.

#### Loch Ard Gorge. 
Has a blowhole, WHOOSH! 

#### Waterfalls
The Visit Victoria website has a long [list of waterfalls](http://www.visitvictoria.com/Regions/Great-Ocean-Road/Activities-and-attractions/Nature-and-wildlife/Lakes-and-waterways/Waterfalls.aspx) along the Great Ocean Road.
