Slightly further than the Grampians, and much smaller, Mt Arapilies is supposed to be the second-best place for rock climbing, abseiling and assorted other rocksports in the world. There are also a number of bushwalking routes at the site.

People from around the globe come here and camp for months just to get their climb on
