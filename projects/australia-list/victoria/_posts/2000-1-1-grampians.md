Big mountains in the middle of nowhere. 

Full of typical “bush” scenery, it is also home to a lot of aboriginal rock art. Some say that it's got the highest concentration of rock art in southeast Australia.

The area is a popular location for bushwalking and rocksports, as well as just camping. It is also known for the native springtime flowering.

Many a winery nearby.
