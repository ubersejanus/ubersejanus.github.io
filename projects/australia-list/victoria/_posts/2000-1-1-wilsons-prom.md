The most southern point of mainland Australia is home to vicious attack wombats, and also features  a Sweet Mountain/large hill that you can climb (Mt Oberon.)

Winds are right off the Antarctic, so can be bitterly cold.

There is a beach named Squeaky Beach. It makes squeaking noises when you run on it. Itâ€™s amazingly fun.

The caravan park is often highly booked, but you can go hiking through the wilderness instead if the mood takes you.

There is also a small collection of cabins down by South Point, although they are a short hike from the nearest roadhead.
