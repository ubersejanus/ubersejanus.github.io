Captain America's is an American-themed and menued restaurant in Ferntree Gully.

If you can eat a 1kg burger and 600g of chips, they will immortalise you on the wall! (while you probably feel really bad about yourself)

If that sounds too easy, why not attempt the Thousand Burger Challenge?

Because you don't know what it is? Well, first you complete a [8.7km walk](https://www.google.com.au/maps/dir/CAPTAIN+AMERICA'S.+HAMBURGER+HEAVEN.,+38+Forest+Road,+Ferntree+Gully+VIC+3156/Quarry+Rd,+Upper+Ferntree+Gully+VIC+3156/-37.8871118,145.3175959/-37.8695844,145.3191498/-37.8719953,145.3120307/-37.8748098,145.3079125/Olivebank+Rd,+Ferntree+Gully+VIC+3156/-37.8776062,145.3005767/-37.8802052,145.2991462/CAPTAIN+AMERICA'S.+HAMBURGER+HEAVEN.,+Forest+Road,+Ferntree+Gully+VIC/@-37.8811494,145.2921601,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m32!4m31!1m5!1m1!1s0x6ad63cbea8fe4b6f:0x367b9a100ba4b6dd!2m2!1d145.2971165!2d-37.8834339!1m5!1m1!1s0x6ad63cc7e45ac5b9:0x690580482c4dc6cb!2m2!1d145.3047099!2d-37.8916456!1m0!1m0!1m0!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x6ad63ca89c283c01:0x4a143563adcef7c!2m2!1d145.3032097!2d-37.8745982!1m0!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x6ad63cbea8fe4b6f:0x367b9a100ba4b6dd!2m2!1d145.2971165!2d-37.8834339!3e2?hl=en) from the restaurant up the Thousand Steps, over the top of One Tree Hill and down the other side before you have your meal.
