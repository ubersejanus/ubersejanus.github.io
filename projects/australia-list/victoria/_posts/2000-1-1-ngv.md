Home to art and so forth, the National Gallery has its main campus on St Kilda Road which is filled with international art and also the Ian Potter Centre, or "NGV Australia" down the road at Federation Square. Founded in 1861, it is Australia's oldest, largest and most-visited art museum.

It's well known water-wall entrance has entranced generations of schoolchildren who weren't super excited about being sent to an art gallery.

Sometimes people complain about the gallery being called the National Gallery of Victoria, since it's run by the State of Victoria and often gets confused with the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra. This is because the NGV was founded before the Commonwealth when Victoria was an "independent" Colony (not to mention flush with Gold Rush funds.) So far as I can tell, the State Government's position is "Get bent. Our gallery is over a century older than NGA, not to mention it's the biggest and best gallery in the country"
