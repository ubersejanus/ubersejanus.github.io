There are two major lookouts that share the best views of the Melbourne suburban area going around. 

The first is called Burkes Lookout. It's popular with people who enjoy pretty lights, photographers, and people who enjoy smoking joints. There's a short walk through the bush to get to the lookout, but it's super worthwhile.

The other option is [Sky High](http://www.skyhighmtdandenong.com.au). It has a fancy restaurant. Otherwise, it's exactly the same as Burkes lookout, only it costs money and isnâ€™t as fun.
