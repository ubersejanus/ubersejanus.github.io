Crossing the Nullarbor is a rite of passage in Australia, possibly because there is absolutely nothing to see while doing it unless you like hundreds of kilometres of straight roads (148km), straight railway lines (478km), and small desert plants.

The late, great Douglas Adams once wrote *The changes that you will undergo as you cross the Nullabor are subtle, but deep, caused by the mind-stretching expanse of nothingness and eerie quiet, where a person can sit perfectly still and look deep inside themselves to the core of  their essence, their reasons for being, and the necessity of checking inside your boots every morning for fatal surprises.*

The road itself actually doesn't really follow the Nullarbor Plain, the world's largest exposed limestone formation, sticking realtively close to the sea, which is nice since the Nullarbor is right up against the Great Australian Bight, and there are many spectacular cliffaces to be admired along the way.

The sunrise and sunsets are absolutely majestic out on the Nullarbor, and I strongly recommend them.

There is also the world’s longest golf course, the Nullarbor Links. It has a hole at 18 roadhouses and townships across the desert. It’s pretty fun!
