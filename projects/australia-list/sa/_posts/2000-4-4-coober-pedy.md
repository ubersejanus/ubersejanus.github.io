Coober Pedy is mostly famous for being one of the centres of Australia's opal mining industry, but there are a few other things that make this a great place to stop &mdash; other than the fact that this is the outback and you need to fuel up.

First of all, the film Pitch Black was filmed here.

Then there's the fact that almost all of the residents live underground to escape the desert heat, and some will happily show you around their sweet cave homes! 



But the most unique thing is probably the [The Coober Pedy Opal Fields Golf Club](http://www.southaustralia.com/info.aspx?id=9008178)

It's an odd golf course. Players carry around their own astroturf to tee off from, and games are usually played at night, using glow in the dark balls.

Despite this, membership is quite sought after, probably because members have reciprocal playing rights at the home of Golf, St Andrews Links in Scotland.
