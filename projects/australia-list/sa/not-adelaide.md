[Adelaide](adelaide) â€¢ **Outback SA**

Outside of Adelaide, South Australia has some of the most stereotypically "Australian" scenery you'll find in the country.

It's so sparesly populated though, that in 60% of the state it isn't worth the bother of having a local council and services are provided by a state government body called the Outback Communities Authority.
