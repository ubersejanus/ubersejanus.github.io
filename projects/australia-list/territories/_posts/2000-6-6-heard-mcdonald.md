At over 4,000km from Perth, the Heard & McDonald Islands are one of the most remote places in the world. 

Originally there were had a couple of sealing stations, they have since been demolished and now itâ€™s deserted, and has since been declared a World Herritage Site.

The islands are uninhabited, subantartic, and have both of the active volcanoes in "Australia".

Would not live in.
