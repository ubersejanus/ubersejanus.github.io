On the other side of the Great Barrier Reef, the Coral Sea Islands are uninhabited, aside from Willis Island, which is home to 4 staff from the Bureau of Meteorology on six-month postings. Many other islands have automated weather stations, but no people.

In short:  
Paradise.  
No idiots.  
Would live in.
