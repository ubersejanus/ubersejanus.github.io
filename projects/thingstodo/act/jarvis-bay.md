[Canberra](canberra) • **Jervis Bay Territory**

The Jervis Bay Territory is an insignificant slice of NSW surrendered along with the ACT in 1915 for long-redundant reasons of protocol. Sorta-kinda a part of the Capital Territory, depending on the context. 

They started work on a nuclear power plant here back in the 70s, but it never got off the ground. You can see assorted foundations on the ground though. But that’s probably the most interesting thing there.

The only other thing of importance is the naval base HMAS Creswell. It is mostly known to the rest of the country as the home of the Royal Australian Naval College, where they train new naval officers. 

I’d give this one a miss.
