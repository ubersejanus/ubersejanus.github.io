[Canberra](canberra) • [Jarvis Bay](jarvis-bay)

When they made Australia, it was decided that the capital city wouldn’t be Sydney or Melbourne. So they designed Canberra instead, to some success.  
Unfortunately, basically no one who isn’t a politician, diplomat or bureaucrat lives here. 

Canberra is famous for having the wildest temperature variations in the country, with lows of -3 degrees in winter and highs of 45 degrees in summer.
