Also trades as the Museum of Australian Democracy, formerly known as Provisional Parliament House.

Basically, when they built Canberra back in the 20’s, they didn’t build a proper parliament building, in fact they were going to rip this one down when Parliament moved up the hill. After a public outcry, they decided to keep it and use it as a museum on how Government and Parliament work.
This also led to a public outcry.

There’s just no pleasing people.

The museum covers things like the Westminster system of government and how British the Australian people saw themselves at the time of the construction of the building. They also hire the building out for period TV shows and movies. All in all, the building is very interesting, although extremely nerdy.
