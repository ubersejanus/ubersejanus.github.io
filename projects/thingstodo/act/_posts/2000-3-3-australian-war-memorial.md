Often regarded as the only thing worth seeing in Canberra, the Australian War Memorial is the nation's major war memorial.

Considered to be one of the most significant national war memorials in the world, the WW1 exhibit has been critically acclaimed since it opened during the 40’s.

The Memorial has one of the world’s largest collections of Victoria Crosses, and the baton of the country's only Field Marshal amongst a lot of other memorabilia.
