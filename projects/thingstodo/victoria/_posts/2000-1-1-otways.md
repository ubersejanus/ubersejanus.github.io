The Otways region is a fantastic example of temperate rainforest, and is suitable picturesque. Great Otway National Park

Attractions include:

#### Great Ocean Walk
One of the great Victorian hikes, the [Great Ocean Walk](http://parkweb.vic.gov.au/explore/parks/great-otway-national-park/things-to-do/great-ocean-walk) is a 100km trek along the shore, through the forests, estuaries and clifftops that run from Apollo Bay to the Twelve Apostles.

#### Melba Gully
Not just a nice picnic area, [Melba Gully](http://www.visitvictoria.com/Regions/Great-Ocean-Road/Activities-and-attractions/Nature-and-wildlife/Wildlife-and-zoos/Melba-Gully.aspx) is also home to colonies of Glow Worms.

Do not point a torch at them! 	

#### Otway Fly
The [Otway Fly](www.otwayflytreetopadventures.com) is an area strung with boardwalks amongst the canopy, so you can look out and see what's happening up the top of these massive trees rather than wandering around on the ground

There are also flying foxes 30m above the forest floor. The smallest spans are 70m long, so thatâ€™s OK, I guess.
