Once upon a time, there was a railway that ran from Lilydale to Warburton, however during the Dark Times of the 1960s, there was a War on Rail, and they ended up tearing up the railway line. Wankers... On the upside though, now it’s a quite pleasant 38km long bike path — it has lots of sweet trestle bridges!
