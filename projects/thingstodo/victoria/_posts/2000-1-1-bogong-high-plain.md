Falls Creek is one of Victoria's largest and best-known Ski resorts. Certainly it's one that I've been to the most &mdash; although that's because of how convenient it is to the backcountry world of the Bogong High Plain. It has a bunch of places to stay, a supermarket, medical clinic, pubs, downhill runs, nice groomed trails... in short, all the mod-cons you would expect from an alpine village.

Of more interest to me though, is the Bogong High Plain.

## Bogong High Plain

Home to the Bogong Rover Chalet, the High Plain is a back country area that until relatively recently was controlled by the monolithic State Electricity Commission of Victoria, as opposed to Parks Victoria, thanks to the Kiewa River Hydroelectric Scheme. There are a number of tasty mountains to climb, and a lot of High Country Huts to visit.

During the snow season, everything is tasty and white, but it's also nice to walk through there whilst everything is green. Mountain Biking is also an option if you can't get your cross-country skiing on.
