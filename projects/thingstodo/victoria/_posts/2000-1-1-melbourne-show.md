Held during the October school holidays, Victoria’s premier Agricultural Show has acres and acres of sweet rides.

It's the reason we have the Royal Melbourne Showgrounds, which is home to many festivals throughout the year.

Generations of Melbourne Children have suffered through being dragged through the display pavillions and blue ribbon competitions and the boring super-boring CWA cake decoration competition before being set loose on the rides. This is the authentic experience.

The Animal Nursery however, children universally love. (once they aren’t terrified of animals, that is)

Catch the woodchopping competition. It is ridiculous how fast those guys can cut a log in two. You’d probably still be picking up the axe by the time they’re done.
