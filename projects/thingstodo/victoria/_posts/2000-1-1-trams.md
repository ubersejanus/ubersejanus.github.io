Melbourne still subscribes to the idea that trams are a good idea.

Basically it’s a small, electric train that runs down the middle of the street (they're technically light rail when they aren't running on a road, but no one calls them that)

Pay attention! (it’s a road, you should be paying attention anyway, but we digress) Trams weigh 30 tons and can cut you in to three lopsided bits without fuss.

This can really mess up your day.

### [The City Circle Tram](http://ptv.vic.gov.au/route/view/1112)

They still run some of the old W Class Trams around in a loop of the CBD, giving a tour of many of the touristy things you can do. Like all trams in the CBD "Free Tram Zone", they don't require a ticket (unlike all other allegedly “public” transport.) 

It's a great way to a) see cool things in Melbourne and b) ride a tram.
