At 1,986 metres above sea level, Mount Bogong is the highest mountain in Victoria.

You can choose to climb the mountain in one day via the staircase, or take longer by starting from Falls Creek, heading down from the Bogong High Plain, crossing Big River and heading down the staircase.

Like any good mountain, there's a cairn at the top so you can easily see when you've beaten nature.
