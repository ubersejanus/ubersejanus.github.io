The state library is a depository library, meaning that if you want to read something that was published in Victoria and you can't find it anywhere else, you can at least borrow it from the State Library.

As well as those millions of publications, you can also see Ned Kellyâ€™s armour, the folios of Captain Cook and the diaries of the founders of Melbourne, John Batman and John Fawkner as well as many other weird and wonderful historical trinkets.

The Chess Room features extensive and world-renowned displays on the history of Chess, if that kind of thing tickles your fancy?
