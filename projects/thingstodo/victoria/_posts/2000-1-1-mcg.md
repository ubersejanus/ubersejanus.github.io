The birthplace of Test Cricket, the MCG is a 100,000 seat stadium that is the spiritual home of Australian Rules Football and the location of AFL Grand Final.

It was also the main arena for the [1956 Olympic Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1956_Summer_Olympics) and includes a pretty impressive sports museum.
