Much of the Dandenong Ranges is covered by the Dandenong Ranges National Park, including the famous 1,000 Steps walk (don't panic, there's only around 800 steps â€” you'll be fine.)

There are also a number of smaller Parks Victoria properties, which aren't all that big on native plants but are still very pretty such as the [National Rhododendron Garden](http://parkweb.vic.gov.au/explore/parks/national-rhododendron-garden).
