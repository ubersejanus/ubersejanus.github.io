      <h3>The Yarra River at Wonga Park</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Wittons+Reserve,+Wonga+Park+VIC+3115/@-37.7172508,145.2836034,15.5z" target="_blank">Map</a></p>
      <p>Rope swing, fast and slow moving water. Way more fun than the public pool.</p>
      <p>Also good at Warrandyte and Warburton, but these places are more likely to be CRAMMED full of other people.</p>

            <p>Sweet mountain views, highly recommended at night.</p>
            <p>Further away than Mt Saint Leonard, but has a taller tower and is still cool.</p>

			<p>Hand-feed Kangaroos, etc</p>

            <h3>Warburton Rail Trail</h3>
            <p><a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Lilydale+to+Warburton+Rail+Trail,+Lilydale+VIC+3140/@-37.759386,145.3586631,17z" target="_blank">Map</a> <a href="http://www.railtrails.org.au/trail?view=trail&id=64" target="_blank">Website</a></p>
            <p>Once upon a time, there was a railway that ran from Lilydale to Warburton, however during the Dark Times of the 1960s, there was a War on Rail, and they ended up tearing up the railway line. Wankers... On the upside though, now it’s a quite pleasant 38km long bike path — it has lots of sweet trestle bridges!</p>

            <h3>O’Shannassy Aqueduct Trail</h3>
            <p><a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/O'shannassy+Aqueduct/@-37.7451095,145.6736038,15z/" target="_blank">Map</a> <a href="http://parkweb.vic.gov.au/explore/parks/yarra-ranges-national-park/things-to-do/oshannessy-aqueduct-trail" target="_blank">Parks Victoria info page</a></p>
            <p>Linked to the Warburton Rail Trail, the trail follows the path of the O’Shannassy Aqueduct, which once carried drinking water between two reservoirs. Once it's finished, there will be 70km worth of sweet, sweet trail from Lilydale to East Warburton</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Maroondah+Reservoir+Park" target="_blank">Map</a> <a href="http://parkweb.vic.gov.au/explore/parks/maroondah-reservoir-park" target="_blank">Parks Victoria info page</a></p>
            <p>Giant lake that stores a small part of Melbourne’s drinking water, so No Swimming.</p>
            <p>It does have some fancy english gardens though. Best of all, there is no objection to you trying to run up the dam wall.</p>

            <p>Sweet riverside town where we lived for a few months once. Easily can believe you’re in the country, you are very much in suburban Melbourne.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The <a href="http://www.stonehouserestaurant.com.au" target="_blank">Stonehouse Cafe</a>
              <ul>
                <li>Great place for breakfast.</li>
                <li>Birds and other assorted creatures will frolic while-you-wait.</li>
