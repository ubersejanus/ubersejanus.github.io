**Melbourne** • [Yarra Valley](yarra-valley) • [Mornington Peninsula](mornington-peninsula) • [Geelong](geelong) • [Ballarat](ballarat) • [Bendigo](bendigo) • [Gippsland](gippsland) • [Western Districts & Shipwreck Coast](western-districts) • [Northern & Northeastern Victoria](northern) • [The Mallee](mallee)

Home of Trams, Australian Rules Football, and us; Melbourne likes to present itself as the Sporting Capital of the World (or at least the Australia-Oceania-Southeast Asia area.)

Also likes to make a big deal of its live music scene and nightlife, not to mention coffee. 

Our other spurious claims include: being the largest Italian city outside of Italy, and the third-largest Greek city, period.
