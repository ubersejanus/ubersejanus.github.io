You surely know about this already, its only on EVERY single brochure for advertising Australia printed since forever. 

I didn't expect for the Opera House to be as close to the Bridge as it's usually depicted but it actually is, which is pretty cool.

Anyway, it's a big music venue. Not just purely for opera, because come on. It's a very pretty building too.
