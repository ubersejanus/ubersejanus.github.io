A nice, tall mountain in the inner north part of the suburbs which offers your standard sweet city view.

There's [a planetarium](https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/facilities-recreation/arts-culture/sir-thomas-brisbane-planetarium-0) at the bottom of the mountain too &mdash; although planets are the same no matter where you see them, to be honest.
