Owned by the family of the late, great Steve "the Crocodile Hunter" Irwin, Australia Zoo is stereotypically associated with crocodiles and obviously other "Australian" creatures as well, but there are also animals from Asia and Africa there too.

They also do a lot of research on crocodiles both at the Zoo and in the wild, as well as Croc Rescue. This was largely what was covered in Steve Irwin's TV show.
