Held in October at Millmerran, near Toowoomba; the Australian Camp Oven Festival is basically a big campsite full of people who are amazing at campfire cooking and only too happy to teach you.

Aside from food, other drawcards include damper-throwing contests, bush poetry readings, sheep shearing demos, and miniature racing pigs, of all things.
