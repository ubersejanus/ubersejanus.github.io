A nice, long, park that most of the below items are scattered through.

On the weekends, there are often sweet "farmer's" markets, with many tasty treats and fancy nick-knacks on offer.

### State Library of Queensland
The [State Library of Queensland](http://www.slq.qld.gov.au) is home to the Tree of Knowledge, birthplace of the Labor Party across the globe.
Interesting, if thinky, exhibits on various pieces of Queensland history

### Queensland Museum/Sciencentre
The [Queensland Museum](http://www.southbank.qm.qld.gov.au) is your standard museum: Home to many an exhibit, some of which are hands-on. It also includes two different Art Galleries

### Streets Beach
Yes, the bastards actually put [a beach](http://www.visitsouthbank.com.au/attractions/streets-beach) in the middle of their city. I mean, technically, the beach is just a big old open-air swimming pool, but it's the thought that counts.

### The Wheel of Brisbane
One of those ferris wheel contraptions that are all too common these days, the [Wheel of Brisbane](http://www.thewheelofbrisbane.com.au) is wheel-shaped and in Brisbane.

### Brisbane Maritime Museum
As it says on the tin, the [Brisbane Maritime Museum](http://www.maritimemuseum.com.au) is home to quite a few boats. Boats are cool.

### South Brisbane Railway Station
It has super ornate benches that you can sit on.  
Also, it seems way too old to not have been knocked down and replaced with something sleek and soulless.
