The Milaa Milla Falls is a waterfall in the town of Milaa Milaa. They are pretty impressive looking, and have been used in many different advertising campaigns, generally with women flicking their hair in a nice fibonacci spiral. This leads to a lot of people trying to recreate similar pictures with either their hair or beard.

Nearby is [The Falls Teahouse](http://fallsteahouse.com.au), which is an excellent place to get lunch.
