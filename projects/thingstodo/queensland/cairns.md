Cairns is the biggest town around Far North Queensland, and roughly 80% of the population are employed in the tourism industry, so there is plenty of cool stuff to do around town.

It's also pretty much surrounded by the [Wet Tropics of Queensland World Heritage Site](http://www.wettropics.gov.au/), so be prepared for some pretty staggering natural beauty.
