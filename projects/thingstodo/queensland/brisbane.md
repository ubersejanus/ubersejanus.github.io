**Brisbane** • [Gold Coast](gold-coast) • [Sunshine Coast](sunshine-coast) • [Bundaberg](bundaberg) • [Cairns](cairns)

The capital city of Queensland. It is pretty small, but it’s pretty nice.

It's probably the most outdoors-y of the various state capitals, but they think that filling the CBD with one-way streets is a good idea, so it's by no means perfect.

Like most developed cities, they have a fancy integrated transport ticketing system, but Brisbane’s public transport includes catamarans all along the river that they call CityKats, and that has always amused me.
