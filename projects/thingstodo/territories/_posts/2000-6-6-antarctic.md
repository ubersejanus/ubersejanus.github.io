Originally claimed by the United Kingdom (naturally,) the Australian Antarctic Territory was placed under the authority of the Commonwealth of Australia in 1933. It is the largest antarctic claim.

Stamps in the name of the Australian Antarctic Territory get issued from time to time. Since there's very little call for mail from the six Australian Antarctic Division bases down there and the stamps are both denominated in AUD and accepted in Australia, they're basically just antarctic-themed Australian stamps with a slightly different name on them.

Some people consider the Antarctic Territory holiday material, but it's pretty hard (and expensive) to get to. 

May we suggest you bring a hat?
