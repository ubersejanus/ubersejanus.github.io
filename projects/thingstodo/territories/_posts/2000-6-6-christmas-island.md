Known primarily for being the place that we dump unwanted asylum seekers while their claims are investigated, this island in the edge of the Indian Ocean is supposed to be pleasant enough.

Christmas Island's other main claim to fame is the Red Crab Migration is insane. Millions of crabs walk from one side of the island to the other over the course of about a week. http://www.christmas.net.au/experiences/red-crab-migration.html  

Charmingly, the capital city and main settlement is officially named Flying Fish Cove.
