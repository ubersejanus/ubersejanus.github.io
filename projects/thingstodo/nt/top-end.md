Some of the best parts of the country. The green part of the outback, rather than the red of Central Australia.

Usually, places divide the year up into the four seasons you are familiar with. In the Top end they come in only two distinct flavours: Wet Season and Dry Season.  
We recommend you visit during the Dry.
