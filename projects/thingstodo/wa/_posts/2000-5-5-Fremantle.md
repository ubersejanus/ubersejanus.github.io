It’s nice. 

Kinda small though. Unlike Geelong or the Gold Coast, Freemantle is a part of metropolitan Perth, which is a little weird for a nominal "second city"

It’s got plenty of sweet-looking buildings though!

**[Little Creatures Brewery](https://littlecreatures.com.au)**

It’s one of the fancier breweries in WA, and they make great beer there too.

**[Western Australian Maritime Museum](http://museum.wa.gov.au/museums/maritime)**

It has all kinds of sweet sea-y stuff:
Australia II our America’s Cup winning yacht
The Oberon-class submarine HMAS Ovens
and some extensive exhibits on the Port of Fremantle & Immigration/Refugee stuff as well.
