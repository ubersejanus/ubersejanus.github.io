<p style="text-align:center;">This website exists to link together various accounts, show where <a href="/map">I've been</a>, what <a href="/achievements">I've done</a>, and also to host <a href="/blog">my blog</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I write about my travels, as well as other things I've done & thought, stuff I've researched, and things I may want to refer back to in future.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I live in Melbourne and spend my time exploring, learning things, climbing, taking photos, Scouting, and being on the internet too much.</p>
