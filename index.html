                <p>Hi, I'm Brad Peters. By day (and occasionally by night) I work as IT Technician, fighting the good fight to ensure that businesses across Victoria have the tools and knowledge they need to succeed and thrive in today's high-tech environment.</p>
                <p>In my spare time, I am one of over 5,000 adult volunteers across the state who support the development of young people through Scouts Victoria. I'm an adventurous activities specialist, with a particular focus on abseiling; and also involved with delivering leader training to the Rover Scout section.</p>
                <p>This website exists to corral social media accounts, show where <a href="/map">I've been</a>, what <a href="/achievements">I've done</a>, and also to host <a href="/blog">my blog</a>. I've been blogging since 2006, but I'm not the most consistent. Mostly, I write about my travels and other things I've done or thought, stuff I've researched, and things I may want to refer back to in future. Hopefully it is of some use to others.</p>
                <p>I live in Melbourne and spend time exploring, learning things, climbing, doing photography, and being on the internet too much.</p>
